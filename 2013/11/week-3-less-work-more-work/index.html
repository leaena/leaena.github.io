    	<p>School-wise, this week was very, very short. Today is Thanksgiving and I’m almost a little shocked that we got it off (although many of my peers are spending their day at the school if the emails about keys and door opening flying back and forth are a good reference). Because of the shortness I was thrown a bit off guard on Monday when I realized that it was time for our 3rd assessment already! This is week three! It feels simultaneously like I’ve been here for days and for years. The assessment went well and I actually remembered all my things from the previous week without too much panic. I did have a hilarious nightmare afterward that involved me being forced to code a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort" target="_blank" rel="external">merge sort</a> algorithm using a pencil and a very limited amount of paper and my lead instructor yelling at me for my terrible handwriting (this is why I love computers! I have terrible penmanship).</p>
<p>Because of the short week we basically just went straight into <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Backbone.js</a> this week, which for my non-coding followers is a JavaScript library that allows you to structure your app cleanly by dividing the work that must be done into the actual data “models” and the way you represent that data to individuals “views”. This concept is what’s called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank" rel="external">MVC</a>, which is one of those trendy/useful buzzwords you hear a lot in coding. Anyway, it’s what we did in class this week and I plan on working on it a bunch over my long weekend.</p>
<p>Unfortunately because this is the longest break I have besides solo project time during Christmas break I think I’ve put more on my to-do list than is physically possible (especially since I promised my platonic life partner <a href="http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ava</a> I would help her with her Hackbright project too). Lets run down what I have on my list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review algorithm time complexity (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank" rel="external">Big O notation</a>)</li>
<li>Practice recursive problems</li>
<li><p>Make business cards:<br><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709350/Screen-Shot-2013-11-28-at-1_33_31-PM_apsxso.png" alt="Personal business cards of awesome"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Work on my Backbone project (we are working on it through next Tuesday, but I want to tackle some of the extra credit)</p>
</li>
<li>Redo/refactor some of my Coderbytes code - I’ve learned a bunch, I can probably do better</li>
<li>Research getting involved in some open source stuff/get some pull requests in to bigger projects</li>
<li>Maybe try learning Ruby on Rails (we might lose out on the Ruby on Rails sprint because of the timeline of holidays)</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, I’m probably a crazy person. Today I will eat and hang out with friends and be merry though. Tonight I will allow the code to creep its way to the front of my brain again. I also plan on writing a more technical article on time complexity sometime this weekend if I can wrap my brain more fully around it so I can pass along the tips I find.</p>
