Thankfully Ava’s an amazing nurse (she’s strict though, she won’t even let me have a Diet Coke).</p>
<p>I did have a fun week rest of the week in spite of how I feel today. Thursday we stayed at home and Ava got some awesome work done on her final project and I just played around some more with Angular tutorials and double checked her semi-colons in JavaScript. Thursday night though, was awesome. We did this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to go to my first ever <a href="http://bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">geek girl dinner</a>! Ava hooked me up and I really hope I can go to more in the future. We went to San Jose to visit <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">CISCO</a>‘s main campus. It was super inspiring and totally pumped me up for next week. Also they had tasty food and gave us T-shirts and I got yelled at by Ava for saying I was a student and not an engineer. I won’t make that mistake again!</p>
<p>Yesterday I trekked through three different transit systems to get back down to San Jose by myself to visit my other bestie and have dinner with her family. We had lots of fun and visited the <a href="http://www.sjlibrary.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">giant library</a> next to the SJSU campus. She and I share a ridiculous love of reading and I think she just wanted to rub it in that I will have no time to read for a long while.</p>
<p>Hack Reactor starts on Monday and I’ve been drinking tea and sitting around in my pajamas all day in hopes of feeling decent by Monday. Wish me luck!</p>
