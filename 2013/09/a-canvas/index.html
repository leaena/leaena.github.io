    	<p>If you’ve tuned in for my regular poetic ramblings on life and web development for the past few days what you probably saw was a site in a bit of a mess. Instead of designing my own WordPress theme I had the zany notion that it would be quicker just to pick a theme and change some things. So instead of writing my own code I spent two days trying on themes like a teenage girl tries on prom dresses - none of them was just quite right. I eventually settled and looked for something that was responsive (meaning I could view it on my computer or my iPhone with ease) and whose structure and CSS was clean and easy to navigate. I settled on <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/tiny-forge-wordpress-theme-for-learning-and-site-building" target="_blank" rel="external">Tiny Forge</a>. It was pretty right out of the box and I just tweaked some colors, threw up my own header image and added some of my widgets to the sidebar.</p>
<p>I have a feeling as I get busier I’ll have even less desire to mess with my personal projects, but currently the need make this site pretty is as strong as it was when I started creating websites, which is pretty cool because I never thought I’d get back there.</p>
<p>When I first became enamored with websites and building my own I, well, I sucked at it obviously. This was back in junior high when I was a part of the weird subculture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petz" target="_blank" rel="external">Petz</a> (I link to the Wikipedia article because the current nature of Petz is sad and pathetic to those of us who started from the beginning) and had a tiny fan site all my own - long-lost to the internet. I can’t even remember what I called it and it was probably on GeoCities (RIP). I couldn’t figure out why images where all red X’s (I never actually uploaded them to the website) and those images I tried to link all had these ugly blue borders around them (oh CSS, how I came to love and despair you).</p>
<p>In 2004 for Christmas my parents bought me a web domain of my very own (this very one) and Leaena as a nickname and a website was born. I jumped quickly into blogs when they became a thing. From <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Blogger</a> to <a href="http://www.movabletype.com" target="_blank" rel="external">MoveableType</a> and back again while trying a billion others like <a href="http://pivotx.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Pivot</a>, <a href="http://textpattern.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Textpattern</a>, etc. Somewhere in there I tried <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="external">WordPress</a> and it stuck (sort of, I think I bounced around a bunch in between).</p>
<p>The problem with all of these blogs up until recently was nothing stuck. I’d write a few posts and then it would just be a static page that I would want to change the layout for once a month or so, but never actually update. So that’s what I did. I wish I had pictures of some of my old sites. I was generally always following the trends. From frames to iFrames to horizontal scrolls. From using CSS to only using Comic Sans at a very small font size (it looks cool tiny guys, promise) to learning box models and divs. All along I wondered why I didn’t actually want to post anything. There were people out there writing constantly about things! in there lives! that sounded neat! I can write, but they always say write what you know and I felt like I didn’t know much of anything.</p>
<p>Then all of this happened, I decided computer science was my way of life, I realized that I enjoyed reading other people writing about their coding and geeky lives, and I realized I could have that life and tell other people about it too. So here’s to the new leaena.com. I’m sure I will be changing layouts every month soon, but at least I’ll also be updating the content as well.</p>
