I’ve started a more grownup sleep schedule then “wake up 20 minutes before you have to leave for work, roll out of bed and throw your hair in a ponytail”. I now go to bed at the same time every night and wake up to my alarm (no snoozing! okay, maybe one hit of the snooze button).</p>
<p>All this so I can wake up at 5:30 and start a version of Couch to 5k. But me being me I couldn’t do the normal old c25k, no! Instead I chose zombies (because I have loved zombies since before they were cool, yeah that’s right, I’m being that annoying person who talks about bands no one knows)!  <a href="http://zombiesrungame.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Zombies, Run!</a> or actually their Zombie 5k intro to be exact is my zombified program. You can find my runs (and the ridiculous pop music I find necessary to wake me up at 5:30 am on my<a href="http://zombiesrungame.com/leaena/" target="_blank" rel="external"> ZombieLink profile</a>). My goal is to finish the 5k program and then start their actual Season content. I have promised to gift myself with expensive, pretty running shoes if I get that far. On my current shortlist:</p>
<p><a href="http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hoka-one-one-stinson-tarmac.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="/images/" alt="hoka one one stinson tarmac"></a><a href="http://www.zappos.com/hoka-one-one-stinson-tarmac-cyan-white-citrus" target="_blank" rel="external">Hoka One One Stinson Tarmac</a></p>
<p>Supposedly this is like “running on pillows” and is designed for the type of running I do - on concrete as I run around the concrete jungle of my city’s downtown. It’s the most expensive one on my list and my least pretty choice, but it’s still at the top because I think it would be super comfy.</p>
<p><a href="http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nike-air-max-tailwind.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="/images/" alt="nike air max tailwind"></a><a href="http://www.zappos.com/nike-air-max-tailwind-5-pink-force-sport-turquoise-varsity-red-metallic-silver" target="_blank" rel="external">Nike Air Max Tailwind+ 5</a></p>
<p>Probably the best mix of bright and comfy. I love anything that screams NEON PINK. Only when I exercise am I a girly girl.</p>
<p><a href="http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nike-air-pegasus.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="/images/" alt="nike air pegasus"></a><a href="http://www.zappos.com/nike-air-pegasus-29-university-blue-bright-crimson-black" target="_blank" rel="external">Nike Air Pegasus+ 29</a></p>
<p>Probably my fav color combo, but it’s out of stock in my size so it’s probably not going to happen. I’m keeping it on the list just in case.</p>
<p>And there we go. I’ve added another obsessive hobby to my life. But at least the running is the first physically good thing I’ve become obsessed with. I think I need to find a zombie t-shirt to run in…</p>
