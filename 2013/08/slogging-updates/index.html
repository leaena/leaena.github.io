I have to do the homework and take one more coding test before they will let me in because I bombed the last coding interview. I’m actually not upset at all. I was worried that I was going to feel obligated to go when I really want to see how my interview with <a href="http://hackreactor.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Hack Reactor</a> goes. I understand that App Academy would be a good choice from a finances perspective, but the raw talent that they seem to be churning out of Hack Reactor is really intriguing, especially when Ruby isn’t my favorite language and JavaScript was the first one I ever learned.</p>
<p>Updates as they come! Hack Reactor interview isn’t until the 20th and I probably won’t try to finish up the App Academy homework until around that time as well.</p>
