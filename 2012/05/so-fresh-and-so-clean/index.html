That’s really all I can say to start off this post. No one will read it anyway and for that maybe I’m glad. leaena.com has been down for probably two months now if I can do my math right. It’s annual billing cycle came and went in March and I was such a ball of mess and unhappiness and I haven’t touched this site in so long that I never even checked. My old site, the one that the DNS servers probably are still pointing to for most people, is dead and gone. It was hosted through <a href="http://asmallorange.com" target="_blank" rel="external">ASmallOrange</a> and I have nothing but good to say about them.  This new site is not hosted there for a variety of reasons. 1) I am too much of a wuss to ever talk to them about unsuspending me/seeing if my info is still backed up and 2) I need a fresh start and to make it completely fresh new blog, new domain hosting (leaena.com is now hosted through <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Namecheap</a> when that whole leave GoDaddy day happened awhile back), and new webhost (<a href="http://mddhosting.com" target="_blank" rel="external">MDDhosting</a>).</p>
<p>My life is still mostly hell (I have a flair for the dramatic, but in reality I’m not in a very happy place right now) and I haven’t done much about it, but I’m taking small steps. I think my goal here is to write every day about something, anything and post it no matter how stupid/personal it is.</p>
