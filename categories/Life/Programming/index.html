    	<p>First week of work is over and it felt a lot like a less intense week of Hack Reactor. I still can’t believe this is what I’m actually doing with my life. I still definitely have lots and lots of impostor syndrome but I also deployed live things my first week! And learned a few of my coworkers names! And did a two minute all staff demonstration on how to knit!</p>
<p>I also got exactly what I wanted. I’m working full stack in JavaScript and Python in non startup-y startup (e.g., we’re not out to make lots and lots of money or making a product we don’t believe in for the money) doing things that I feel are making a tangibly good contribution. We have a gong that gets rung when a person graduates a class. That small bit right there proved that I was exactly where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>And yes, I’m still terrified some days that I’m too slow or too newb or just not cut out for this, but here’s a secret, I don’t think that will ever go away. Maybe it’s a good thing or maybe it’s just human nature, but I just need to learn to live in my own skin I think and take the impostor syndrome as a mark of being human, of caring about my work and wanting to always get better.</p>
<p>And a minor update: Selma is no longer in the house, I got the balls to move her outside finally.</p>

    	<blockquote>
<p><strong>Impostor syndrome</strong> describes a situation where someone feels like an impostor or fraud because they think that their accomplishments are nowhere near as good as those of the people around them. Usually, their accomplishments <em>are</em> just as good, and the person is being needlessly insecure.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="external">Geek Feminism Wiki</a><br>The lack of posting this week is entirely related to the above quote. I spent the long weekend working on my pre-course work for HackReactor. It was awesome and fun and sometimes frustrating but I was powering through it. Then somewhere on Sunday, I got stuck. It was a stuckness of monumental proportions and looking back on it now I find it funny.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a method to my madness with coding. I add things, test them and add some more until I get stuck at a point where either I’m not sure how to implement something to make it do what I want or something I thought I’d implemented isn’t doing what I expected it to. Then I do a bunch of Googling, look at some examples, hack those examples to fit into my code and all is well again.</p>
<p>And that’s how it should have gone when I got stuck on Sunday. Instead I kept banging my head against the brick wall of stuckness, moving some code bits, rewording some code bits, and finally starting all over again in frustration. By Tuesday night as I had a Google Hangout date with my best friends, I was freaking out. Please keep in mind that I’d received this homework on Friday and I don’t have to finish it until I start school in November <strong>and </strong>at the point of my stuckness I was <strong>about half way through with all of it</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, the freak out was definitely unwarranted. I made it this far but I’m still worried I’m making a bad choice/going to be that one person in their program who doesn’t get a job/nobody will ever love me. You know normal fears.</p>
<p>It’s a day by day process telling myself I’m good enough. Today I finally came back to the thing I was stuck on and sorted out my issues in about an hour. Now I’m on to the last step, my best friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" target="_blank" rel="external">recursion</a>.</p>

    	<p>As an addition to my post below about App Academy. I’m starting to feel less confident in myself. I did well on the second coding test and I’m through the first interview now but according to the website I assumed that meant it was my only interview. Not so said the TA who put me through a coding test. So ugh. I was nervous, I got it done, but not prettily and I made some stupid mistakes. When I finished I was upset and called both my parents and my best friend. My dad was the best about the whole situation. He just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t give up if I didn’t get in to this ONE program. He was right.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening prepping applications to the other programming schools in the Bay Area. I finished one for <a href="http://codingdojo.co" target="_blank" rel="external">Coding Dojo</a> and got an email this morning to set up an interview next week! I also applied to <a href="http://hackreactor.com" target="_blank" rel="external">HackReactor</a> which has suddenly vaulted itself to the top of my list. Not gonna lie, the free gym and really high success rate of graduates makes me happy. Both of those programs are also in November so they are my three that I’m most excited about. I also will probably apply to <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Dev Bootcamp</a> and <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Hackbright</a>, but they aren’t until next year and I don’t want to wait that long if I don’t have to.</p>
