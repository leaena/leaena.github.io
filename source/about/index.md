[![Lindsey Smith](http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2013-08-15-07.43.09-225x300.jpg)](http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2013-08-15-07.43.09.jpg)Lindsey Smith is having a 20something-life crisis right now. She quit her government job to spend three glorious and terrifying months in San Francisco in the Nov '13 cohort at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). Watch her as she navigates on very little sleep and a whole lot of public transit, struggles to become and actually feel like a web developer, tries to get in shape, and maybe, possibly relearns Chinese.

Besides the crazy life stuff she loves Diet Coke with Lime, anything ever created by Joss Whedon, and complete geeks. She's also surprisingly willing to talk in the third person for long periods of time. You can reach her directly at lindsey [at] clevergirl.me.
