Getting me through the work days/coding breaks lately are a couple of podcasts I just discovered:

[Welcome to Night Vale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-night-vale/id536258179?mt=2)

[Throwing Shade](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/throwing-shade/id479583266?mt=2)

and an old favorite, back when I had time to watch their livestream [The Co-optional Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/polaris-channel/id667537837?mt=2) (formerly TGS Podcast).
