This entire week has been a wild and crazy adventure toward finding jobs. We spent lots of time making our resumes look awesome and making sure all of our online presences look like we knew our stuff. Shockingly, I think it's working! I've actually had some interest from companies and recruiters on LinkedIn and AngelList! I have a couple of interviews scheduled for later next week, but because I haven't been able to dive into coding, I've had a lot of time to sit with my decisions and I'm suddenly really, really nervous.

Next week is the start of something new and I've done more new things in the past few months than I have in my entire life. I interviewed/got accepted to Hack Reactor, I quit my job, I moved out-of-state, I started a crazy intense engineering program and now it's like I'm done with the program and get to start a new great unknown. Next Tuesday is Hiring Day, which means companies get to decided whether I'm awesome or not (and one of my top choices of jobs is going to be there) and Wednesday my team is demoing [Helix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8BBP-DxIw), onstage, for the [Famo.us](http://famo.us) Beta Launch Preview. And that's not even the end of it, I have two phone interviews already scheduled for later in the week and hopefully more if things from Hiring Day pan out.

Everyone around me is telling me I'm capable, but I don't have that same confidence. It's not even that I think I'm not a capable coder, I know I am. I'm just worried that I'm not going to show off my potential. I'm terrified of the rejection (because I know there has to be at least some) and I'm worried about making the best choices for me when the time comes.

On the other hand, I really look forward to seeing how amazing everyone is going to do. I hope we all kill it. Most of all I hope we're all happy. &lt;3
