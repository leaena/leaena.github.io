I've been in love with [Lorde](http://lorde.co.nz/) (she's only 16!) for a little while now, her song Royals has been playing on the Portland alt rock station for the past few months and I immediately went and found all of her music. I've been using this song as my confidence boost. I like to repeat "I'll find my own bravado" to myself as I work on coding or just randomly at work. Not out loud though. I'm not _that_ crazy - yet.
