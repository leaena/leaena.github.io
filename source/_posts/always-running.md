The quietness of this weblog isn't a reflection on my life, more like the inverse of my life now. I've started a more grownup sleep schedule then "wake up 20 minutes before you have to leave for work, roll out of bed and throw your hair in a ponytail". I now go to bed at the same time every night and wake up to my alarm (no snoozing! okay, maybe one hit of the snooze button).

All this so I can wake up at 5:30 and start a version of Couch to 5k. But me being me I couldn't do the normal old c25k, no! Instead I chose zombies (because I have loved zombies since before they were cool, yeah that's right, I'm being that annoying person who talks about bands no one knows)!  [Zombies, Run!](http://zombiesrungame.com) or actually their Zombie 5k intro to be exact is my zombified program. You can find my runs (and the ridiculous pop music I find necessary to wake me up at 5:30 am on my[ ZombieLink profile](http://zombiesrungame.com/leaena/)). My goal is to finish the 5k program and then start their actual Season content. I have promised to gift myself with expensive, pretty running shoes if I get that far. On my current shortlist:

Supposedly this is like "running on pillows" and is designed for the type of running I do - on concrete as I run around the concrete jungle of my city's downtown. It's the most expensive one on my list and my least pretty choice, but it's still at the top because I think it would be super comfy.

Probably the best mix of bright and comfy. I love anything that screams NEON PINK. Only when I exercise am I a girly girl.

Probably my fav color combo, but it's out of stock in my size so it's probably not going to happen. I'm keeping it on the list just in case.

And there we go. I've added another obsessive hobby to my life. But at least the running is the first physically good thing I've become obsessed with. I think I need to find a zombie t-shirt to run in...
