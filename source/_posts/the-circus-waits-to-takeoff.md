About a year ago for giggles I tried the [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) class at [Code School](http://http://www.codeschool.com/). I mean, it's **zombies. **I am a huge zombie fangirl and I was getting back into Java programming at the time but wanted to learn something more web develop-y. Anyway, I got frustrated with Ruby/Rails. There were parts of it that just bugged me. So I stopped.

Then a few weeks ago I discovered Python. It was an immediate love. I started with [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) mixed in with [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com)'s Python lessons. Also I'm in love with the [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/). I've been reading it like a novel.

Then I wandered around looking for things to do with my newfound love. Django just seemed too big for my very newb hackings. I can't remember where but a blog somewhere out there in my searchings mentioned [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). So I plugged that little baby into my cobbled together Python studio (i.e. my newly reformatted Windows 7 laptop) and felt a little overwhelmed. Undeterred I searched out tutorials and decided to start with [this one](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/python-tutorials/an-introduction-to-pythons-flask-framework/) which just creates some static pages (I'm moving on to more dynamic things as I post this).

Pic spam!!

My first Flask generated page. Isn't it gorgeous?

Added some pretty pretty CSS (I missed web design, it's been awhile):

[![css](http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/css-237x300.png)](http://leaena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/css.png)

And ta-da:

And then I added navigation and a second page:

And just because I find it pretty, my recolored PowerShell:
