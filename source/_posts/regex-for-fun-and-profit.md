I've always been a bit intimidated by regex (or [Regular Expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) for the uninitiated). In a nutshell, regular expressions are these archaic looking bits of symbols that when put together look bizarre but actually are used to search for specific characters in a chunk of text/input. For example **[^0-9]** means search for the first non-numeric character (the ^ is a not, so **[0-9]** would be search for the first _numeric_ character). I've used them a few times, but only by looking up other peoples versions and mucking around with it until it it gives me something like what I want.

Then [Ava](http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com/) introduced me [Regex Crossword](http://regexcrossword.com/) and I knew that if she could do it I could sure as heck learn it too. I breezed through (or to be more accurate bashed through utterly confused) the introduction and part of the beginner puzzles and then got royally stuck. I had never formally learned regex and still didn't have a clue what half of it meant. Off I went searching for a good tutorial, which was harder than I thought.

I first found [Learn Regex the Hard Way](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/), and while I normally like the [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/) stuff the regex version isn't finished and wasn't really helping. I like interactive things that tell me whether I am even on to the right track of a clue. But then I found [RegexOne](http://regexone.com/) which checked all my boxes! It gives you a bit of a lesson on each new character and then makes you test it out before you move on to the next lesson. I completed the beginning tutorials on there and decided to try the Crosswords again, feeling much more confident.

I got stuck again almost immediately. It was time for some good old fashioned cheating. I discovered [Regexper](http://www.regexper.com/) and at first didn't think it would be much of a help, but let me tell you, I was wrong. You can copy a regular expression into the text box and it will give you a humanized version with actual words and descriptions. With that in my tool belt I was no longer stuck and am now halfway through the intermediate challenges.

I'm not sure I'll ever really _enjoy_ regex, but at least now it doesn't just look like magic.
