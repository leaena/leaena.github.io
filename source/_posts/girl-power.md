I've spent the past few week inundating my friend Ava, the one who starts [Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com/) on Monday, with women in tech articles and sites online. She suggested I try to collect them all in one place, so here we go:

**Big Sites:**

*   [Ada Initiative ](https://adainitiative.org/)- Conferences, lobbying, mentoring. Lots of good stuff. Articles and video on [Impostor Syndrome](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/impostor-syndrome-training/).
*   [Systers]( http://anitaborg.org/initiatives/systers/) - I just joined their mailing list. Lots of interesting discussions. Some of them don't really apply to me, but it's all inspiring. I really want to go to the [Grace Hopper Celebration](http://gracehopper.org/) someday.
*   [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com) - Articles and teachables by women for women. Ava especially loved the [Confusion is your friend](http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/07/confusion-is-your-friend/) blog post.
*   [Women 2.0](http://women2.com/) - All sorts of career/education/tech stuff for women.
*   [She's Geeky](http://shesgeeky.org/) - General geekiness for women, lots of rotating meetings/'unconferences'.
*   [ChickTech](http://www.chicktech.org/) - Currently focused in my hometown, they've done some amazing things for high school age girls.
**Individual Articles:**

*   [Empowering Women By Code](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682231/empowering-a-new-generation-of-tech-savvy-women-by-teaching-them-to-code) - An interesting article and how I learned about Skillcrush.
*   [Women in Technology](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/women-in-technology-kara-swisher_n_1519806.html)Â - Small article/AWESOME video clip. Hilarious.
*   [Why aren't more girls attached to physics](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/09/210251404/why-arent-more-girls-attracted-to-physics) - An NPR audio clip Ava sent me on why women don't go in to STEM.
*   [Student's 'Meltdown' Blogpost](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2012/12/students-meltdown-blog-post-leads-to-deeper-look-at-student-stress-at-mit352) - This isn't entirely women based, but it does talk a lot about impostor syndrome (everyone seems to get it!) and the original blog meltdown is an interesting/sad/slightly life-affirming read.
*   [Miss America is a Nerd!](http://culturallydisoriented.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/a-salute-for-nina-davuluri-and-crystal-lee/) (not really tech, but awesome)
[This will probably be a continually updated list for a while. I'll sticky it to the top of the page for now.]
