Week 3 work wise was more of the same... awesome! I'm learning intricacies of our system and learning how to not act like I don't know things (because I do know things! I just need to be less nervous about it!)

My favorite part of the week though was the weekend. On Saturday I volunteered as a Tech Mentor with CoderDojo for an all girl (10-17) JavaScript intro. I was actually pretty happy that most of the girls didn't need a ton of help! And I got to introduce looking things up in the docs to a few of them! The girls were SO creative too. There is a short write up of what they worked on here: http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/04/coderdojo-js-workshop-for-girls-great.html

Also, can I just say that Pamela Fox is amazeballs? She spoke once while I was at Hack Reactor and I've been following her for awhile on Twitter, but she's just awesome (I was fan-girling a bit when I realized she'd be the instructor for the class). She's such a good presenter and was really awesome with the girls.

Like I was telling Ava, I have a feeling that if I wanted to I could fill up all my weekends with tech mentoring/hanging out at places like http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/ and http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/ and http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/. It's definitely something I want to do. It's why I wanted Udacity and I feel like it's something I wish I could have had back in Oregon, women showing women that tech careers are awesome and possible and here's how to make it happen.
