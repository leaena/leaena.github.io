I have discovered a new sense of zen since I got my job offer. I've also discovered amusing things about myself. The biggest and most noticeable change is in my music choices. When I was stressed and scared and about to go to an interview I would want nothing more than to listen to a couple of songs over and over again. [Bravado](http://youtube.com/watch?v=xV_xHBdLFSk) was one, [Problem](http://youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrZI6OmezE), [Wrecking Ball](http://youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8), and [Dark Horse](http://youtube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0) were my staples. I needed strong songs sung by women that I knew by heart. I listen to basically nothing else. Now I'm still listening to them, but I've added back in old favorites and non-female vocals like [We Fought Monsters](http://youtube.com/watch?v=No5NiaK97vE#), [I Hear the Bells](http://youtube.com/watch?v=plDNCnCik6c#), and [Madness](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0SgwWmF9w). It feels awesome emotionally and physically. Music is a huge factor in my moods and it's awesome to be able to experience the full range of it again.
