Starting this countdown to California/Hack Reactor has brought back my love of learning in ways that online classes couldn't do. I love to learn. I'm the kind of girl that if I don't know the answer to your question (["Are inch worms an inch long?"](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-inchworms.htm) - bad example as I do know that they get their name from the way they "inch" forward, but still), I will stop the conversation immediately, whip out my phone and find you the answer. I'm sure I've pissed off friends and relatives, but I think they are used to me by now. It's something that I just _have_ to do. Some people will make up things or say "who cares", but I really want to get down to the truth, learn a new bit of trivia, something.

So now that I'm learning more things I keep coming up with questions. Like suddenly the veil has been lifted and JSON isn't this mythical acronym but something I can actually parse and use. But my brain of course took it a step further. APIs are similar, right? - said my brain. But what exactly _are_ they? I've pulled data out of one but it was very hand-holdy. How does that data even get there? How does an app get an API? To Google, my friends.

According to [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com/), APIs are tools individuals can use to access companies'/individual apps' data and functions. They allow external users to access internal info safely. There's _lots_of stuff on this page though and my eyes kinda glazed over about half a page down. Time for a new track.

I learn better by doing so maybe make our own little API? Unsurprisingly, the internet has us covered. Let's [Create your first API](http://blog.andreaolivato.net/programming/create-your-first-api-set-in-php.html). This is in PHP and very straightforward. But if you're like me, you may want something in our own favorite web app language: JavaScript! So let's go ahead and try [Creating a REST API Using Node.js](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/).

Obviously I've only just scratched the surface of this stuff but I want to try and play around with this and more in my last two weeks of down time. One last link for good measure: [How to Design a Good API](http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf)
