My best friend, Ava, starts [Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com/) next week! So proud of her and it's awesome to have someone so close who's going to be going through the same things I am. She just started up a blog: [Ava Goes to Hackbright](http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com/). In her inaugural post she talks about the same issue I mentioned earlier: impostor syndrome.
