Sorry for the delay in this post. My roommate, Ava, was worried about my long hours all week so she wouldn't let me touch my laptop on Sunday. Saturday night was card games with Hack Reactor peeps so I was out late. It was a jumble of a week and I'm writing this so late that this week is already upon me. So I think this one will be very short.

We started working at Famo.us this past week. They have a beautiful office that was converted from an apartment. It's weird to go back to Hack Reactor now with their darker rooms and only two bathrooms, but I still miss it something fierce when I'm away. Hack Reactor feels like home, but Famo.us is a nice vacation. Our project is slowly progressing. We have some really neat ideas about gene visualization and if all goes well we'll get to demo the awesomeness in front of a bunch of people.

Other fun things from this week included a talk on Thursday from the author of Cracking the Coding Interview and Saturday social night where I got my ass handed to me in Marvel vs. Capcom and then made people squirm in Cards Against Humanity.

One final thing: Ava talked me into buying a FitBit! I've been meeting all my goals every day and it's pink so life is pretty amazing. You can find me on Fitbit [here](http://www.fitbit.com/user/2CM7FN).
