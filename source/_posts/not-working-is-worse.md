So first off, mad props to those of my cohort who have jobs now too! And major hearts to those still looking, because y'all are amazing. And a special shout out to my platonic soul mate Ava who starts at SurveyMonkey in a week!

I have had two weeks of quiet reflection (read scrambling to get an apartment, utilities and furniture in my pad) and it sucked. While I definitely don't want to go back to the terrifying job finding phase anytime soon, at least I felt like I was doing things (and I got to code once in a while). Now I'm just sitting around waiting for utility services to call me back or deliver my stuff or de-spidering my apartment (mostly dead, the one that's alive I'm naming Selma, because I'm a giant crippling softie who can't even kill bugs).

I start work on Monday and I'm nervous-excited-terrified-ecstatic. I'm already on the email lists and I love the few random all-staff conversations I've read. I think the culture here will be awesome. My zen today though has been putting together IKEA:

And a super special thank you to Ava for being awesome and watching TV with me and putting together my table:
