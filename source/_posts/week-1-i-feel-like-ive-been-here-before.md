First week of work is over and it felt a lot like a less intense week of Hack Reactor. I still can't believe this is what I'm actually doing with my life. I still definitely have lots and lots of impostor syndrome but I also deployed live things my first week! And learned a few of my coworkers names! And did a two minute all staff demonstration on how to knit!

I also got exactly what I wanted. I'm working full stack in JavaScript and Python in non startup-y startup (e.g., we're not out to make lots and lots of money or making a product we don't believe in for the money) doing things that I feel are making a tangibly good contribution. We have a gong that gets rung when a person graduates a class. That small bit right there proved that I was exactly where I wanted to be.

And yes, I'm still terrified some days that I'm too slow or too newb or just not cut out for this, but here's a secret, I don't think that will ever go away. Maybe it's a good thing or maybe it's just human nature, but I just need to learn to live in my own skin I think and take the impostor syndrome as a mark of being human, of caring about my work and wanting to always get better.

And a minor update: Selma is no longer in the house, I got the balls to move her outside finally.
