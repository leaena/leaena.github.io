I definitely plan to keep up with my Sunday/Monday posting schedule but I'm not sure what to call these anymore. When I was in Hack Reactor it was easy to call them "Week #: (insert witty title)" and now I think I just have to continue with my old standby of vaguely overwrought witty/melodramatic titles or it will take all the fun out of my posts.

Any illusions I had of getting some sleep after Hack Reactor was over was complete wishful thinking. I have been moving and doing and emailing and talking and coding and my life is just as crazy as ever... and I love it. That terrified feeling from the last week of Hack Reactor is gone. I mean, obviously there are nerves and ups and downs to this whole process, but there are also the awesome moments. The fun of coding challenges and flexing my brain at a whiteboard. The awesome talks with some really cool engineers and just the constant feeling that I'm still learning and growing as an engineer even when I'm not technically "learning".

And just to prove there ain't no rest for the wicked, over the weekend I attended the Launch hackathon. We weren't doing it to win any prizes but I attended with a couple of the Hack Reactor ladies and we had a lot of fun putting [Marmot Creek](http://marmotcreek.herokuapp.com) together. Also, for my zen like moment of the week, a picture from the wharf this morning:
