I got called a rockstar today. I'm trying to make myself believe it. All I have left to do that's required is the recursion stuff. Then there's a bunch of extra credit that I want to try to go all the way through. [Code School](http://codeschool.com) has a new (free) [intro to JavaScript](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1)Â module that I also want to see if I can find too easy.

Non programming fluff the past few days. Family was in town and I'm starting to pack up the apartment I've lived in for four years. Subconsciously I seem to think the faster I clean out my apartment the sooner I get to move down to California. I think my subconscious is going to be disappointed when I have a bare apartment and another month of work in Salem.

In other news I am starting to hoard nerdy t-shirts. I bought a couple of [Welcome to Nightvale](http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Category_Code=CPB) shirts as well as some 'verse (Whedonverse, that is) related ones from [Once upon a Tee](http://onceuponatee.net/) ([Buffy](https://www.onceuponatee.net/all-products/slayer-of-the-vampyres/), [guns don't kill people](https://www.onceuponatee.net/all-products/joss-kills/), and [I hate the homeless](http://www.onceuponatee.net/all-products/i-hate-the-homeless/), specifically).
