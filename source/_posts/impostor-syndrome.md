> **Impostor syndrome** describes a situation where someone feels like an impostor or fraud because they think that their accomplishments are nowhere near as good as those of the people around them. Usually, their accomplishments _are_ just as good, and the person is being needlessly insecure.>

The lack of posting this week is entirely related to the above quote. I spent the long weekend working on my pre-course work for HackReactor. It was awesome and fun and sometimes frustrating but I was powering through it. Then somewhere on Sunday, I got stuck. It was a stuckness of monumental proportions and looking back on it now I find it funny.

I have a method to my madness with coding. I add things, test them and add some more until I get stuck at a point where either I'm not sure how to implement something to make it do what I want or something I thought I'd implemented isn't doing what I expected it to. Then I do a bunch of Googling, look at some examples, hack those examples to fit into my code and all is well again.

And that's how it should have gone when I got stuck on Sunday. Instead I kept banging my head against the brick wall of stuckness, moving some code bits, rewording some code bits, and finally starting all over again in frustration. By Tuesday night as I had a Google Hangout date with my best friends, I was freaking out. Please keep in mind that I'd received this homework on Friday and I don't have to finish it until I start school in November **and **at the point of my stuckness I was **about half way through with all of it**.

So yeah, the freak out was definitely unwarranted. I made it this far but I'm still worried I'm making a bad choice/going to be that one person in their program who doesn't get a job/nobody will ever love me. You know normal fears.

It's a day by day process telling myself I'm good enough. Today I finally came back to the thing I was stuck on and sorted out my issues in about an hour. Now I'm on to the last step, my best friend [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion).
