I had my first interview with [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) today. That was _awesome_. It was a 180 from my two [App Academy](http://appacademy.io) interviews. Doug from HackR was amazing. First of all, he was on time! I figured that was a good omen. But then he was also funny and sweet even though my Skype was being funky initially. I felt very at ease by the time the initial coding assessment came around. It was actually kinda fun and straightforward and he told me I'd moved on to the take home and technical interview! We scheduled it on the spot and I took the first opening available (_next_ Tuesday). We then chatted a bit more (I learned that they take about 30 students now and had 5 women the last go round).

Basically I'm just really, really excited and _beyond_ glad I decided to focus on just this program. I think it is exactly what I'm looking for.
