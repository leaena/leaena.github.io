I made it. I landed in SFO yesterday and here I am sitting in [Ava's](http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com) apartment in Burlingame and realizing I packed way too many sweaters. Seriously, it started raining in Portland as we were flying to the airport and then I get here and it's gorgeous - slightly breezy but super sunny.

In many ways it feels like I was on vacation and now I'm back, fitting right back in to the swing of friends and California. The other half of me wavers between feeling like now is the vacation and realizing that I'm going to be here for a while. At the airport I was so excited but then as I hugged my parents goodbye and entered the queue for TSA I started bawling. This is new and scary and as much as I want this, my safety net is mostly gone. I can't just drive an hour and end up at my parents' house.

I just need to breathe and give myself some time and start doing fun things. And then just tell myself the worst that could happen is I decided after the three months is over that I want to go home and find a job in Portland (I really doubt I will feel that way by that point, but it's comforting).

This was supposed to be a happier post, but really I just needed to say everything that I'm thinking. I also want to be able to link to this post a year from now and see how much has changed because this last year has been tremendous. Also palm trees still make me smile.
