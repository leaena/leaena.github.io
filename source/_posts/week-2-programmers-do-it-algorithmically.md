I have less pretty pictures for you this week. The most I saw of the sunshine looked similar to this:

At least it was sunshine. It "rained" for like a minute one day and the umbrellas came out en masse. I was perfectly happy in a hoodie, but I definitely felt like an outsider. I might need to buy an umbrella, this whole trying to not look like a tourist thing is harder than I thought. Although I've had more people ask me for directions this week than I ever have in my life combined so I think the hair and the nose piercing are good SF camouflage.

This week was a teensy bit rollercoastery for me. We started out with a fairly easy CSS/fun jQuery tricks problem and then tackled a pretty epic sprint on the [N-Queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) problem. N-queens is the idea that you need to place n (a number) of chess queens on an nxn chess board so that none of the queens can attack any other queen. I think they've only solved it up to 27 ([ and that was people from Hack Reactor](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/43651/)). I got a little flustered with that one as algorithms were never my strong suit before this (it's why I got the "conditionally acceptance" at App Academy - thank god, might I add). I think though I'm just being too hard on myself. Not every software engineer deals with something as crazy as the n-queens problem on an everyday basis. Our more traditional daily toy problems (similar to tech interview questions) are fairly straight forward and I can code a [bubble sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm in about 5 minutes (maybe 10 with one hand tied behind my back).

I think that's what Hack Reactor has done for me more than anything else. It's made me accept my flaws, but know that everyone has them and there is always more to learn. I'm a good intuitive coder, but I'm no good with the lingo of it. We all are here to learn to become **great** <del datetime="2013-11-24T22:21:58+00:00">coders</del> Software Engineers.

Short post this week, sorry. I have dinner with friends to go to and my Sunday is too peaceful and sunny (and full of awesome 50th anniversary Doctor Who) for any more words.
