How is it possible that I've already been working for Udacity for two weeks?!

I have done real tangible things since last week (I did real, tangible things my first week but nothing I could really point you to). This week, I integrated Github linking!! If you have an account on Udacity, you can now link your Github account to it [here](https://www.udacity.com/account#!/linked-accounts). This doesn't actually do much more at the moment, but it's all a part of a master plan. If you don't have a Udacity account (why not?!) or aren't using Github, here's an action shot from my account:

I'm settling in to my place a little more (I also discoveredÂ the spider I threw outside was not Selma, but Selma is in fact outside now too). I have a new whiteboard that is currently just practical (groceries and upcoming things), but I'm sure it will end up with weird pictures of animals and penises.

My plans this weekend involve groceries and finally getting a San Mateo County library card, so I'm pretty excited!
