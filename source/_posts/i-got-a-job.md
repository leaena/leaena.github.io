So, that was quick. Here I was whining and freaking out about the job search and instead I find myself settled in a week and a half.

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer at [Udacity](http://udacity.com)! I am so excited. Everyone there seems so awesome and I really believe in online/alternate education and have always wanted to get into that niche.

So no sob stories to read about here for another few months. Instead you'll get to read about my shenanigans trying to find an apartment, bringing my kitties down from Oregon, and buying everything in IKEA.
