As an addition to my post below about App Academy. I'm starting to feel less confident in myself. I did well on the second coding test and I'm through the first interview now but according to the website I assumed that meant it was my only interview. Not so said the TA who put me through a coding test. So ugh. I was nervous, I got it done, but not prettily and I made some stupid mistakes. When I finishedÂ I was upset and called both my parents and my best friend. My dad was the best about the whole situation. He just wanted to make sure I wouldn't give up if I didn't get in to this ONE program. He was right.

I spent the rest of the evening prepping applications to the other programming schools in the Bay Area. I finished one for [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.co) and got an email this morning to set up an interview next week! I also applied to [HackReactor](http://hackreactor.com) which has suddenly vaulted itself to the top of my list. Not gonna lie, the free gym and really high success rate of graduates makes me happy. Both of those programs are also in November so they are my three that I'm most excited about. I also will probably apply to [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com) and [Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com), but they aren't until next year and I don't want to wait that long if I don't have to.
