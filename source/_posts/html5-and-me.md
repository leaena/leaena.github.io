So I'm "officially" done with the pre-course work for Hack Reactor. Remember that freakout a few posts back? Remember? Because I do and it makes me laugh out loud. I'm still going to work on all of the extra credit bits that they included but I have a month to go and I want to do some stuff I want to do. So here goes the site redesign I said wasn't coming just a post ago.

While I redesigned this website and finally created my own minimal theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) I really wanted to learn the new awesome HTML5 tags that I'd only breezed through in the past. My first question was can I have multiple headers? Should I have multiple headers? According to [Common HTML5 Mistakes](http://html5doctor.com/avoiding-common-html5-mistakes/), the answer is no on the "should" part at least.

My next rabbit hole was how those fancy newfangled button thingies work. I thought about using them for my main nav buttons, but after reading some [Stack Overflow on Valid Button Uses](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14461658/are-button-html-tags-outside-of-a-form-valid) I decided against it. Instead I just used some block divs.

From there I wanted it to be pretty. I have been reading about usability in web design. I'm starting to understand the [Contrast Rebellion](http://contrastrebellion.com/). I really want colors/fonts that are [easy to read](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/code-colorizing-and-readability.html), still a little [trendy](http://www.shift8creative.com/posts/view/the-web-s-most-viral-colors), and with an eye to the [UX vs UI](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/ui-vs-ux-whats-the-difference/) issues.

Some other fun things I used/found useful:

*   [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/Stream-IN-color-theme-2901832/) - my color inspiration
*   [Custom Text Select Color](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2012/11/set-custom-text-highlight-color-with-css.html) - for the heck of it
*   [CSS Selectors](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/) - more than I remember learning in web design
*   [WP-Markdown](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/) - I've started using Markdown and wanted to use it to blog too
*   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) - much easier comment management
*   [HTML5 Reset](http://html5reset.org/) - ridiculously simple wordpress theme with no styling that I hacked to bits
