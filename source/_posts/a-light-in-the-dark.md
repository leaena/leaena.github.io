I'm about a week and a half away from the end of the school term and these last few weeks are devoted almost entirely to final projects in both of my classes. The more "important" class involves a lot of OOP theory and some lovely easy Java programming (except the final which is in C++, which for some reason I can't find the love for). The fun one is my game design class. It doesn't really count for anything for me and it's not really programming, even though I'm eeking out as much code as I can in [GameMaker](http://yoyogames.com) (we have to use it).

My final for the fun class is to create a an original game and write a giant design doc on the process, but I'm hopelessly enamored with the actual game now. The problem with this is that I want to really, really code it. Not just mess around. Enter a vague knowledge that there are things out there more advanced and a few Google searches later I'm staring at Visual C# 2010 Express and some online tutorials on [XNA](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/).

I'm really trying to put the brakes on this. Not forever, but just until I can finish up the term. I have no plans to continue with school for a while. I've done everything I can online, now comes getting a new car and an actual will to drive into Portland so I can finish my 2nd Bachelors and I don't think I will see those goals met before 2013\. I'm studying for the CompTIA A+ exam, but I think maybe it's time I designed a computer game. Also June is [National Game Development Month](http://nagademo.com/), which is not helping because my projects aren't due until June 14th and I really would love to design a game this month.
