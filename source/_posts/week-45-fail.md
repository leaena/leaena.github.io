Life has been awesome, so awesome in fact that I have had no time to put words to "paper". I'm finishing projects and starting new ones at work. I'm having fun with friends on weekends. I even signed up for online dating, but that's a hilarious post all by itself.

I also managed to do the age old terror inducing thing that most programmers do at least once in their lifetime. I broke our website. It was fast, over before most people noticed and totally my fault. The silver lining was that I was able to also fix my own mess without much assistance and in less than an hour. Still I felt like an idiot for the rest of the day.

The next day though we were on to the next feature, the next quirk, and I was able to breathe again because I'm slowly realizing that none of this will ever be the end of the world. Just like I don't believe any one thing can "disrupt" the way we do things (and I hate that most startups think that they will), I believe that we can all help to shape something. That we each contribute our own little parts and my contributions also don't have to be perfect. We have code reviews and tech leads and lots and lots of awesome mentoring opportunities to fill in our lack of knowledge.

Also, FYI, I'm including my Twitter feed to the right for now because I update it more than it might this blog.
