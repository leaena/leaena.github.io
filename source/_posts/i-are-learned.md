Whoohoo. The [Interactive Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) class over at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) just opened up. I decided to sign up for with a friend of mine who has much less programming experience than I do. Mostly for the lulz and because I've discovered I love teaching other people about my (limited) knowledge. I started her off just building websites then started her on JavaScript and I finally showed her the prettiness of Python and she wanted to learn it too.

Also I'm messing around with the layout of this website. So it will probably be a bit messy for the next few weeks (I say weeks because I'm down with a cold and my brain is having a hard time focusing for long periods).
