An interesting rant from Reuters on [end-user hate of sticky navigation bars](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/10/11/kill-the-sticky-nav/) (those logo/navigation combos that stay on top of your screen even as you scroll down the page). I find myself more and more interested in user experience data. My first love is definitely promoting/encouraging women in technology, but I can be fickle and have more than one love, right?
