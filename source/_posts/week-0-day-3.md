Still pretty quiet here. I've been helping [Ava](http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com/) with her game and looking at some basic tutorials for [Backbone](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-part-1-getting-started/) and [Angular](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-a-web-app-from-scratch-in-angularjs/). Then I got sidetracked into [learning](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) [VIM](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor).

I _did_ hike up the epicness that is Taylor St on a lunch break with Ava to go look at [Huntington Park](https://plus.google.com/100448725560279017918/about?rfmt=s&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us). The views were amazing and I **love** that I can still wear a T-shirt (no sweater/coat necessary) at all times, even on my evening trek to the BART station and <del>"home"</del> home (Ava was upset by the quotes around the word home so I had to change it).

On the way up:

Looking down:

Looking at the Bay Bridge through the buildings (another thing I love, it looks like stereotypical San Francisco everywhere, tall buildings, funky old fixtures, and a strange mixture of people types):
