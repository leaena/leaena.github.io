Of course as soon as I type up a list of my recent finds of women in tech sites Huffington Post goes and makes [a better one](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4005325?show_comment_id=288464721&amp;utm_content=buffer97cbf&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer). This covers a lot of the biggies. Ones I have my eye on helping with (or following in the footsteps of) once I have more street cred.

My dream at this point is to definitely get my hands dirty, start small with volunteering, and someday teach/advocate for women in tech and STEM in general.
