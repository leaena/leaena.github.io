I'm up late listening to the entertaining people discuss numbers and psychics on Coast to Coast. I'm also sitting on a mattress on the floor of my best friend's apartment. There are two tiny Chihuahuas snoring at my feet and I just want to grin.

I'm on vacation from the real world for a week. I took a week off, flew down to California and I'm basking in the sun and the closeness of friends who really get me. I've even made a new friend in the past few weeks and of course she lives down here too. I'm tired but happy and I'm positive now that this is the place I want to live. All the time. Everyday.

I want to move to California. I want to shake things up and become a web developer and live the life I fantasize about. I kept waffling between computers and accounting, but accounting was the safe and easy way out. I knew the path. I knew it would be another two years before I had to start making tough decisions. For computers, the tough decisions start NOW. I need to get down to California, try to get into a program and then figure out what exactly it means to work in a little development company that could disappear in 5 years. It's terrifying and yet I can't stop smiling.

Also, I'm back with A Small Orange hosting. I just loved them too much not to go back.
