    	<p>So I’m “officially” done with the pre-course work for Hack Reactor. Remember that freakout a few posts back? Remember? Because I do and it makes me laugh out loud. I’m still going to work on all of the extra credit bits that they included but I have a month to go and I want to do some stuff I want to do. So here goes the site redesign I said wasn’t coming just a post ago.</p>
<p>While I redesigned this website and finally created my own minimal theme for <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WordPress</a> I really wanted to learn the new awesome HTML5 tags that I’d only breezed through in the past. My first question was can I have multiple headers? Should I have multiple headers? According to <a href="http://html5doctor.com/avoiding-common-html5-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="external">Common HTML5 Mistakes</a>, the answer is no on the “should” part at least.</p>
<p>My next rabbit hole was how those fancy newfangled button thingies work. I thought about using them for my main nav buttons, but after reading some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14461658/are-button-html-tags-outside-of-a-form-valid" target="_blank" rel="external">Stack Overflow on Valid Button Uses</a> I decided against it. Instead I just used some block divs.</p>
<p>From there I wanted it to be pretty. I have been reading about usability in web design. I’m starting to understand the <a href="http://contrastrebellion.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Contrast Rebellion</a>. I really want colors/fonts that are <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/code-colorizing-and-readability.html" target="_blank" rel="external">easy to read</a>, still a little <a href="http://www.shift8creative.com/posts/view/the-web-s-most-viral-colors" target="_blank" rel="external">trendy</a>, and with an eye to the <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/ui-vs-ux-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="external">UX vs UI</a> issues.</p>
<p>Some other fun things I used/found useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/Stream-IN-color-theme-2901832/" target="_blank" rel="external">Adobe Kuler</a> - my color inspiration</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeitpretty.com/2012/11/set-custom-text-highlight-color-with-css.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Custom Text Select Color</a> - for the heck of it</li>
<li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/" target="_blank" rel="external">CSS Selectors</a> - more than I remember learning in web design</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/" target="_blank" rel="external">WP-Markdown</a> - I’ve started using Markdown and wanted to use it to blog too</li>
<li><a href="http://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Disqus</a> - much easier comment management</li>
<li><a href="http://html5reset.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML5 Reset</a> - ridiculously simple wordpress theme with no styling that I hacked to bits</li>
</ul>

    	<p>If you’ve tuned in for my regular poetic ramblings on life and web development for the past few days what you probably saw was a site in a bit of a mess. Instead of designing my own WordPress theme I had the zany notion that it would be quicker just to pick a theme and change some things. So instead of writing my own code I spent two days trying on themes like a teenage girl tries on prom dresses - none of them was just quite right. I eventually settled and looked for something that was responsive (meaning I could view it on my computer or my iPhone with ease) and whose structure and CSS was clean and easy to navigate. I settled on <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/tiny-forge-wordpress-theme-for-learning-and-site-building" target="_blank" rel="external">Tiny Forge</a>. It was pretty right out of the box and I just tweaked some colors, threw up my own header image and added some of my widgets to the sidebar.</p>
<p>I have a feeling as I get busier I’ll have even less desire to mess with my personal projects, but currently the need make this site pretty is as strong as it was when I started creating websites, which is pretty cool because I never thought I’d get back there.</p>
<p>When I first became enamored with websites and building my own I, well, I sucked at it obviously. This was back in junior high when I was a part of the weird subculture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petz" target="_blank" rel="external">Petz</a> (I link to the Wikipedia article because the current nature of Petz is sad and pathetic to those of us who started from the beginning) and had a tiny fan site all my own - long-lost to the internet. I can’t even remember what I called it and it was probably on GeoCities (RIP). I couldn’t figure out why images where all red X’s (I never actually uploaded them to the website) and those images I tried to link all had these ugly blue borders around them (oh CSS, how I came to love and despair you).</p>
<p>In 2004 for Christmas my parents bought me a web domain of my very own (this very one) and Leaena as a nickname and a website was born. I jumped quickly into blogs when they became a thing. From <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Blogger</a> to <a href="http://www.movabletype.com" target="_blank" rel="external">MoveableType</a> and back again while trying a billion others like <a href="http://pivotx.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Pivot</a>, <a href="http://textpattern.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Textpattern</a>, etc. Somewhere in there I tried <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="external">WordPress</a> and it stuck (sort of, I think I bounced around a bunch in between).</p>
<p>The problem with all of these blogs up until recently was nothing stuck. I’d write a few posts and then it would just be a static page that I would want to change the layout for once a month or so, but never actually update. So that’s what I did. I wish I had pictures of some of my old sites. I was generally always following the trends. From frames to iFrames to horizontal scrolls. From using CSS to only using Comic Sans at a very small font size (it looks cool tiny guys, promise) to learning box models and divs. All along I wondered why I didn’t actually want to post anything. There were people out there writing constantly about things! in there lives! that sounded neat! I can write, but they always say write what you know and I felt like I didn’t know much of anything.</p>
<p>Then all of this happened, I decided computer science was my way of life, I realized that I enjoyed reading other people writing about their coding and geeky lives, and I realized I could have that life and tell other people about it too. So here’s to the new leaena.com. I’m sure I will be changing layouts every month soon, but at least I’ll also be updating the content as well.</p>

    	<p>Oops. That’s really all I can say to start off this post. No one will read it anyway and for that maybe I’m glad. leaena.com has been down for probably two months now if I can do my math right. It’s annual billing cycle came and went in March and I was such a ball of mess and unhappiness and I haven’t touched this site in so long that I never even checked. My old site, the one that the DNS servers probably are still pointing to for most people, is dead and gone. It was hosted through <a href="http://asmallorange.com" target="_blank" rel="external">ASmallOrange</a> and I have nothing but good to say about them.  This new site is not hosted there for a variety of reasons. 1) I am too much of a wuss to ever talk to them about unsuspending me/seeing if my info is still backed up and 2) I need a fresh start and to make it completely fresh new blog, new domain hosting (leaena.com is now hosted through <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Namecheap</a> when that whole leave GoDaddy day happened awhile back), and new webhost (<a href="http://mddhosting.com" target="_blank" rel="external">MDDhosting</a>).</p>
<p>My life is still mostly hell (I have a flair for the dramatic, but in reality I’m not in a very happy place right now) and I haven’t done much about it, but I’m taking small steps. I think my goal here is to write every day about something, anything and post it no matter how stupid/personal it is.</p>
