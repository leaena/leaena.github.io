    	<p>If you’ve tuned in for my regular poetic ramblings on life and web development for the past few days what you probably saw was a site in a bit of a mess. Instead of designing my own WordPress theme I had the zany notion that it would be quicker just to pick a theme and change some things. So instead of writing my own code I spent two days trying on themes like a teenage girl tries on prom dresses - none of them was just quite right. I eventually settled and looked for something that was responsive (meaning I could view it on my computer or my iPhone with ease) and whose structure and CSS was clean and easy to navigate. I settled on <a href="http://mtomas.com/1/tiny-forge-wordpress-theme-for-learning-and-site-building" target="_blank" rel="external">Tiny Forge</a>. It was pretty right out of the box and I just tweaked some colors, threw up my own header image and added some of my widgets to the sidebar.</p>
<p>I have a feeling as I get busier I’ll have even less desire to mess with my personal projects, but currently the need make this site pretty is as strong as it was when I started creating websites, which is pretty cool because I never thought I’d get back there.</p>
<p>When I first became enamored with websites and building my own I, well, I sucked at it obviously. This was back in junior high when I was a part of the weird subculture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petz" target="_blank" rel="external">Petz</a> (I link to the Wikipedia article because the current nature of Petz is sad and pathetic to those of us who started from the beginning) and had a tiny fan site all my own - long-lost to the internet. I can’t even remember what I called it and it was probably on GeoCities (RIP). I couldn’t figure out why images where all red X’s (I never actually uploaded them to the website) and those images I tried to link all had these ugly blue borders around them (oh CSS, how I came to love and despair you).</p>
<p>In 2004 for Christmas my parents bought me a web domain of my very own (this very one) and Leaena as a nickname and a website was born. I jumped quickly into blogs when they became a thing. From <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Blogger</a> to <a href="http://www.movabletype.com" target="_blank" rel="external">MoveableType</a> and back again while trying a billion others like <a href="http://pivotx.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Pivot</a>, <a href="http://textpattern.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Textpattern</a>, etc. Somewhere in there I tried <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="external">WordPress</a> and it stuck (sort of, I think I bounced around a bunch in between).</p>
<p>The problem with all of these blogs up until recently was nothing stuck. I’d write a few posts and then it would just be a static page that I would want to change the layout for once a month or so, but never actually update. So that’s what I did. I wish I had pictures of some of my old sites. I was generally always following the trends. From frames to iFrames to horizontal scrolls. From using CSS to only using Comic Sans at a very small font size (it looks cool tiny guys, promise) to learning box models and divs. All along I wondered why I didn’t actually want to post anything. There were people out there writing constantly about things! in there lives! that sounded neat! I can write, but they always say write what you know and I felt like I didn’t know much of anything.</p>
<p>Then all of this happened, I decided computer science was my way of life, I realized that I enjoyed reading other people writing about their coding and geeky lives, and I realized I could have that life and tell other people about it too. So here’s to the new leaena.com. I’m sure I will be changing layouts every month soon, but at least I’ll also be updating the content as well.</p>

    	<p>I’ve spent the past few week inundating my friend Ava, the one who starts <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hackbright</a> on Monday, with women in tech articles and sites online. She suggested I try to collect them all in one place, so here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Big Sites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adainitiative.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ada Initiative </a>- Conferences, lobbying, mentoring. Lots of good stuff. Articles and video on <a href="http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/impostor-syndrome-training/" target="_blank" rel="external">Impostor Syndrome</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://anitaborg.org/initiatives/systers/" target="_blank" rel="external">Systers</a> - I just joined their mailing list. Lots of interesting discussions. Some of them don’t really apply to me, but it’s all inspiring. I really want to go to the <a href="http://gracehopper.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grace Hopper Celebration</a> someday.</li>
<li><a href="http://skillcrush.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Skillcrush</a> - Articles and teachables by women for women. Ava especially loved the <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/07/confusion-is-your-friend/" target="_blank" rel="external">Confusion is your friend</a> blog post.</li>
<li><a href="http://women2.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Women 2.0</a> - All sorts of career/education/tech stuff for women.</li>
<li><a href="http://shesgeeky.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">She’s Geeky</a> - General geekiness for women, lots of rotating meetings/‘unconferences’.</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chicktech.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">ChickTech</a> - Currently focused in my hometown, they’ve done some amazing things for high school age girls.<br><strong>Individual Articles:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682231/empowering-a-new-generation-of-tech-savvy-women-by-teaching-them-to-code" target="_blank" rel="external">Empowering Women By Code</a> - An interesting article and how I learned about Skillcrush.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/women-in-technology-kara-swisher_n_1519806.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Women in Technology</a> - Small article/AWESOME video clip. Hilarious.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/09/210251404/why-arent-more-girls-attracted-to-physics" target="_blank" rel="external">Why aren’t more girls attached to physics</a> - An NPR audio clip Ava sent me on why women don’t go in to STEM.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2012/12/students-meltdown-blog-post-leads-to-deeper-look-at-student-stress-at-mit352" target="_blank" rel="external">Student’s ‘Meltdown’ Blogpost</a> - This isn’t entirely women based, but it does talk a lot about impostor syndrome (everyone seems to get it!) and the original blog meltdown is an interesting/sad/slightly life-affirming read.</li>
<li><a href="http://culturallydisoriented.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/a-salute-for-nina-davuluri-and-crystal-lee/" target="_blank" rel="external">Miss America is a Nerd!</a> (not really tech, but awesome)<br>[This will probably be a continually updated list for a while. I’ll sticky it to the top of the page for now.]</li>

    	<p>About a year ago for giggles I tried the <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Rails for Zombies</a> class at <a href="http://http://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Code School</a>. I mean, it’s <strong>zombies. </strong>I am a huge zombie fangirl and I was getting back into Java programming at the time but wanted to learn something more web develop-y. Anyway, I got frustrated with Ruby/Rails. There were parts of it that just bugged me. So I stopped.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks ago I discovered Python. It was an immediate love. I started with <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank" rel="external">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> mixed in with <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Codecademy</a>‘s Python lessons. Also I’m in love with the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python</a>. I’ve been reading it like a novel.</p>
<p>Then I wandered around looking for things to do with my newfound love. Django just seemed too big for my very newb hackings. I can’t remember where but a blog somewhere out there in my searchings mentioned <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Flask</a>. So I plugged that little baby into my cobbled together Python studio (i.e. my newly reformatted Windows 7 laptop) and felt a little overwhelmed. Undeterred I searched out tutorials and decided to start with <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/python-tutorials/an-introduction-to-pythons-flask-framework/" target="_blank" rel="external">this one</a> which just creates some static pages (I’m moving on to more dynamic things as I post this).</p>
<p>Pic spam!!</p>
<p>My first Flask generated page. Isn’t it gorgeous?</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709047/flask1_zlv6gg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Added some pretty pretty CSS (I missed web design, it’s been awhile):</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709044/css_non8g2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And ta-da:</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709052/flask2_dwdvad.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And then I added navigation and a second page:</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709055/flask3_ie5axs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And just because I find it pretty, my recolored PowerShell:</p>
