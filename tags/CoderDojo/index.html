    	<p>Week 3 ended a few days back (sorry y’all I had a busy weekend) and it was awesome. I’m learning new intricacies of our systems and learning to be more confident in myself when I know I know it (or maybe even think I do! Being wrong isn’t the end of the world!). My favorite part of this week though was the weekend.</p>
<p>On Saturday I got to volunteer at an all girl (10-17) JavaScript intro class with CoderDojo. I was a tech mentor, but I didn’t have to do a lot . I was super impressed with the girls! And I got to teach a couple of them that docs are super helpful! They were all so creative and awesome and I hope a lot of them decide that programming is as awesome as I think it is. For a short write-up (and to see what some of the girls made!) check out the write up for the event <a href="http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/04/coderdojo-js-workshop-for-girls-great.html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, as an aside, can I just take a moment to say that I think Pamela Fox is amazeballs? She spoke at Hack Reactor during my time there and I’ve been following her on Twitter for a while, but I fan-girled hard when I realized she was the instructor for the class. She is such a smart, funny presenter and she was amazing with the girls. I aspire to be more like her when I “grow up”.</p>
<p>I could see myself filling my weekends with tech mentoring/hanging out at places like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/" target="_blank" rel="external">Women Who Code</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/" target="_blank" rel="external">Girl Develop It</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/" target="_blank" rel="external">PyLadies</a>. It’s something that I’m super passionate about (it’s why I wanted to work at Udacity so badly). I think mainly because it’s something I wish I had when I was growing up. I wish I could have seen women being awesome programmers, making a career out of it, and how much fun it could be. I never thought I would be one of those people who didn’t just have a “job” they had a calling, but I’m positive I’ve found me.</p>
