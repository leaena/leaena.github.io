    	<p>I’ve always been a bit intimidated by regex (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank" rel="external">Regular Expressions</a> for the uninitiated). In a nutshell, regular expressions are these archaic looking bits of symbols that when put together look bizarre but actually are used to search for specific characters in a chunk of text/input. For example <strong>[^0-9]</strong> means search for the first non-numeric character (the ^ is a not, so <strong>[0-9]</strong> would be search for the first <em>numeric</em> character). I’ve used them a few times, but only by looking up other peoples versions and mucking around with it until it it gives me something like what I want.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://avagoestohackbright.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ava</a> introduced me <a href="http://regexcrossword.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Regex Crossword</a> and I knew that if she could do it I could sure as heck learn it too. I breezed through (or to be more accurate bashed through utterly confused) the introduction and part of the beginner puzzles and then got royally stuck. I had never formally learned regex and still didn’t have a clue what half of it meant. Off I went searching for a good tutorial, which was harder than I thought.</p>
<p>I first found <a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Learn Regex the Hard Way</a>, and while I normally like the <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Learn Code the Hard Way</a> stuff the regex version isn’t finished and wasn’t really helping. I like interactive things that tell me whether I am even on to the right track of a clue. But then I found <a href="http://regexone.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">RegexOne</a> which checked all my boxes! It gives you a bit of a lesson on each new character and then makes you test it out before you move on to the next lesson. I completed the beginning tutorials on there and decided to try the Crosswords again, feeling much more confident.</p>
<p>I got stuck again almost immediately. It was time for some good old fashioned cheating. I discovered <a href="http://www.regexper.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Regexper</a> and at first didn’t think it would be much of a help, but let me tell you, I was wrong. You can copy a regular expression into the text box and it will give you a humanized version with actual words and descriptions. With that in my tool belt I was no longer stuck and am now halfway through the intermediate challenges.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’ll ever really <em>enjoy</em> regex, but at least now it doesn’t just look like magic.</p>
