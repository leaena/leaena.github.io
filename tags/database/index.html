    	<p>If I didn’t know me better I’d say I was a little manic this week compared to last. This week I was cold, tired and hungry most of the time. I had my ups, down and whiny moments. My credit card was blocked because apparently the soda machine in the mall is shady to my bank. It was a quick fix, until my Clipper Card (the way I pay for my train - which I take every day, twice a day) ended up being blocked because it had tried to autoload cash during the 3 hour window of downtime on my credit card. It takes up to a week to reprocess so I’m forced to buy crappy little paper tickets and not use the $30 I already had stored on my train card. I ended up buying a coat and neon pink gloves just to make me happy (and warmer). Allow me to be a woman for a moment and do a bit of style blogging:</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leaena/image/upload/v1391709357/Screen-Shot-2013-12-14-at-11_08_37-PM_c6t4au.png" alt="Style blogging grey jacket"></p>
<p>I obviously didn’t spend all my time buying cheap, warm clothing though. I spent most of my time in class having moments of excitement followed by moments of wanting to crawl under a desk and take a nap. I’m not sure what I’d do without the upcoming Christmas break, but it wouldn’t be pretty. What I will say instead is that I may have found my niche in programming.</p>
<p>This week was all about ‘backend’ which means pretty much what it sounds like. It’s a lot of the behind the scenes decisions that have to happen to decide what page you’re looking for and what data to put there. We did more <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Node.js</a> servering and powered through different types of databases and how to hook them in and beat them into a format we can use well enough with our front-end JavaScripting (the answer is JSON, for the viewers at home). Finally, when I thought I couldn’t take any more (and I was half right), we started on <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Angular</a>, another MV* framework like <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Backbone.js</a>, but with some magic and some sleight of hand that allows you to do most of the work directly on the HTML.</p>
<p>I lurve the backend. I really find page routing and JSON calls and database building/retrieving from to be super interesting. It almost feels like a tangible thing where the app over the top is just a pretty cover for the awesomeness that makes it all happen.</p>
<p>We start our lives as Software Engineers next week - a short two-day solo project sprint followed by the start of our first group project. I’m super excited to have a bit more freedom. I’m also terrified of working on my own and having it crash and burn. I really hope excitement wins out.</p>
<p>After the solo project I hope I can write-up a bit about my experiences and show off my (crappy?) solo app.</p>
