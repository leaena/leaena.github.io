I’m learning intricacies of our system and learning how to not act like I don’t know things (because I do know things! I just need to be less nervous about it!)</p>
<p>My favorite part of the week though was the weekend. On Saturday I volunteered as a Tech Mentor with CoderDojo for an all girl (10-17) JavaScript intro. I was actually pretty happy that most of the girls didn’t need a ton of help! And I got to introduce looking things up in the docs to a few of them! The girls were SO creative too. There is a short write up of what they worked on here: <a href="http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/04/coderdojo-js-workshop-for-girls-great.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/04/coderdojo-js-workshop-for-girls-great.html</a></p>
<p>Also, can I just say that Pamela Fox is amazeballs? She spoke once while I was at Hack Reactor and I’ve been following her for awhile on Twitter, but she’s just awesome (I was fan-girling a bit when I realized she’d be the instructor for the class). She’s such a good presenter and was really awesome with the girls.</p>
<p>Like I was telling Ava, I have a feeling that if I wanted to I could fill up all my weekends with tech mentoring/hanging out at places like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/</a>. It’s definitely something I want to do. It’s why I wanted Udacity and I feel like it’s something I wish I could have had back in Oregon, women showing women that tech careers are awesome and possible and here’s how to make it happen.</p>
