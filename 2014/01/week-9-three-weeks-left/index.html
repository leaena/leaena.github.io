    	<p>My week started out fairly average. We were all rolling along on our projects and then I noticed an event on the Hack Reactor Senior calendar. Tuesday, three weeks from this past Tuesday, is Hiring Day. Three weeks?? Not even now, more like two?? Oh, god. And yet, as much of a whirlwind as this has been and as often as I have impostor syndrome, I’m a little excited. I want to see what’s out there for me and find a job and learn and grow and do my instructors proud.</p>
<p>One slight stumbling block for me this week: Hacker in Residence positions. I applied and think I would have been accepted, but I had to bow out. After I sat down and thought about it, I just couldn’t justify being out of work that much longer (even on a stipend). It would have been fun to learn how to teach and spend some more time hacking on personal ideas, but that’s what weekends are for, right?</p>
<p>We also got to demo Helix for the first time. Helix is a gene visualization app that shows you your SNPs (base pairs) from <a href="http://23andme.com" target="_blank" rel="external">23andme</a> that have traits attached to them (according to <a href="http://snpedia.com" target="_blank" rel="external">SNPedia.com</a>). You can search traits or just browse your chromosomes for interesting info. It was built using a private beta framework (called <a href="http://famo.us" target="_blank" rel="external">Famo.us</a>) that my team was lucky enough to get to be involved with. We have <em>fingers crossed</em> two more opportunities to demo Helix, one more run through at Hack Reactor and if all goes well, a private party/meetup for Famous.</p>
<p>Another fun thing that came out of Helix was that I got to dust off my Python knowledge. I had wanted to try BeautifulSoup (a Python web scraper) for a while now and I needed an easy way to pull rsid information from SNPedia so I created my own API wrapper! The code is available (including instructions on how to run it on your own) on my <a href="http://github.com/leaena/snp-api" target="_blank" rel="external">github account</a>. It’s a tiny Python/Flask server that only has a couple of endpoints (the ones I really needed) but I’m thinking about expanding eventually.</p>
<p>And then I got sick. I came down with a cold on Friday and haven’t been to HackReactor since. I’ve been working from home, but mostly just trying to sleep, having weird dreams, and sounding pitiful. I’m getting better though and I will definitely be on-point on Monday to work out the last-minute details of Helix before all the demos come crashing around us.</p>
<p>Three more weeks until I graduate! My gift to myself - I’m attending the <a href="http://hackathon.launch.co/" target="_blank" rel="external">LAUNCH hackathon</a> with two other women from HackReactor the weekend after it’s all over. I just don’t want to get lazy!</p>
