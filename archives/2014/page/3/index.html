    	<p>Coming back from break was wonderful. I really missed this place and these people and I’m at a point now where I’m excited to walk in the front door of this space. I am really, truly a Software Engineer. I have been for a long time, but it took this place and these people to pull that knowledge out of myself. I started the week with giant hugfests of awesome. It was great to see everyone after two weeks. There was some unexpected lack of (and new growth of) facial hair and general fun stories about hijinks had during our time away. We all quickly felt the glory of being seniors and then were promptly blown away by how awesome the new batch of juniors are.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time to chat though, juniors were starting their hell week and we were about to embark on a different sort of hell - Hiring Day Assessments. I was terrified. I’ve decided my brain just needs to have something to focus on being terrified about to function at all - I’m starting to wonder if losing my fear would also diminish my awesomeness. We had all day to finish our assessments and as I dove in my confidence built. I knew this stuff. I knew it from the times it had been drilled into my head and the moments when I was working on something alone and would need to Google a concept and those times at the lunch table with my peers discussing wild and crazy new concepts. It rocked to realize how awesome we all are now. Everyone can tell us we are awesome until their blue in the face, but it’s moments like that when it clicks for me.</p>
<p>The other moments it clicks for me is the new, terribly unfunny programming jokes we’ve all started making. It’s getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>After Monday’s stress, we quickly got our hands dirty in our code. Our first round of group projects wrapped this week. I worked with <a href="http://sarabinns.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Sara</a> and <a href="http://www.joaostein.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="external">João</a> to make a custom html5 video player plugin to vote on moments in videos and visualize the user data. Our project is called <a href="http://heatvote.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">HeatVote</a>. We’re still hacking on it in our “free time”, but its production cycle is officially over. There are a few previous posts on things I worked on for this project and I feel like I have a book more to write about the experience, but time is, as my faithful readers know, very short lately so I’m going to close this book for now.</p>
<p>Our next project period starts on Tuesday. I was fortunate enough to get a client project working with an awesome team to create mobile web apps at <a href="http://famo.us/" target="_blank" rel="external">famo.us</a>! I am very excited to dive into unfamiliar territory, learn, and help out a team of super talented people.</p>

    	<p>Do you have all the data and none of the visuals? Do you just want a pretty, fast way to compare lots of data that centers around maybe just a handful of moments?</p>
<p><a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">D3.js</a> can help you tame all of your data and <code>d3.rollup</code> is especially useful if you have lots of data that you need to combine into just a couple of data points. All it takes is a couple of (pretty long) lines of code and you will have an awesome visual that’s very customizable.</p>
<p>Lets start with a really straightforward example of a rollup. In all of these examples, I’m using code straight from my HeatVote project, which requires me to pull voting data from our server API that I receive as a <a href="http://jsonblob.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">JSON blob</a>. Here’s an example entry:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>{ video_id: <span class="string">'T-D1KVIuvjA'</span>,
  timestamp: <span class="number">2</span>,
  vote: <span class="number">1</span>,
  id: <span class="number">1</span>,
  createdAt: Sat Dec <span class="number">21</span> <span class="number">2013</span> <span class="number">14</span>:<span class="number">55</span>:<span class="number">42</span> GMT-<span class="number">0800</span> (PST),
  updatedAt: Sat Dec <span class="number">21</span> <span class="number">2013</span> <span class="number">14</span>:<span class="number">55</span>:<span class="number">42</span> GMT-<span class="number">0800</span> (PST) }
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now obviously there are a bunch of these, and technically there are easier ways to do this, but to show off the structure of a rollup, lets count how many entries we had in our database using a d3 rollup!</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> total = d3.nest()
  .rollup(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(d)</span>{</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> d.length;
  })
  .entries(data);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Remember, <code>data</code> here is my array of JSON entries, so in our rollup function the <code>d</code> is just shorthand for all of the data. This isn’t a very interesting example though, lets take a look at something that really shows off the beauty of a d3 rollup.<br><br><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> averages = d3.nest()
  .key(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(d)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> d.timestamp;
  })
  .sortKeys(d3.ascending)
  .rollup(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(d)</span>{</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> d3.mean(d, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(g)</span> {</span>
      <span class="keyword">return</span> +g.vote;
    });
   })
   .entries(data);
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now there is a <strong>lot</strong> going on in this very compact few lines, so well go through them one by one, but the result is that <code>averages</code> is equal to an array of objects with the properties <code>key</code> (that is equal to each unique timestamp) and <code>value</code> (that is equal to the mean of all votes at that timestamp).</p>
<p>So lets break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.key(...)</code> is just used to tell the function what our keys are, only grabbing unique values of that property.</li>
<li><code>.sortKeys</code> is just a prettiness thing, it sorts my keys into an order (when they’re pulled off the server the only order is by the time they were created on the database).</li>
<li>and finally our lovely <code>.rollup(...)</code>. Now instead of d being an array of the whole data, it’s now an array of only the data for each individual key (so all of the data with the same timestamp). The inner function <code>d3.mean</code> takes a specific property from all of the data for each key and averages them up.<br>And that, is d3 rollup in a nutshell, it’s really lovely at coercing relationships out of your raw data and you can obviously do a lot more with it that just averaging things. The <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#wiki-d3_nest" target="_blank" rel="external">d3 nest docs</a> are probably the next best place to look to get your hands dirty (.rollup is a property of nest).</li>
</ul>
